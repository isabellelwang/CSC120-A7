Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In the Library class, the methods I overloaded are addTitle and returnBook. In the addTitle method, I allowed two string inputs of the title to allow more than one books to be checked into the library circulation. It would check to make sure both books are not in the system yet before adding the books. Then I also overloaded the returnBook for patrons to return more than one book. The program also checks to ensure the books are not in the system yet before accepting the returns of both titles. 

In the Cafe class, I overloaded sellCoffee and restock methods. I overloaded sellCoffee to sell coffee with no sugar or cream. Then I also overloaded restock method to restock the sugar packets and cream, because sometimes people want to add more sugar packets and creamers into their coffee.

Then, in the House class, I overloaded the constructor. The first overloaded method only has name, address, and hasDining. This constructor is for houses with one floor and no elevator. Then another overloaded method only has address and hasDining has parameters. This applies to houses with no names, one story, no elevator, and has dining. 

Some things that worked was overloading and overriding and calling on the superclass. While I was able to connect the classes from A6 to the new Building class, I did have trouble in the beginning. I had to rename my files from A6 to something different than A7, and then the subclasses would link to the super class. I would advise students to understand how inheritance and polymorphism works because it is very useful in programming.
